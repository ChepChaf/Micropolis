# Micropolis Unity Version

Micropolis is a ground up C# rewrite of the MicropolisCore system using the [Unity Technologies graphics engine](https://unity3d.com/) to create a full blown Micropolis native game that runs on Windows, Mac, and Unix. 

Micropolis on Unity includes a fully working city simulation game true to the original along with several new features and improvements.
